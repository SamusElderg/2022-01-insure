Hey wardens, apologies for the late notice, but we are going to push back the start time for this contest (new time to be confirmed, but I would expect at least 24 hours) to give the Insure team a little more time to set up their repo. We try to avoid doing this whenever possible, but we also want to ensure that you all have the best possible information and context to work with! Thanks so much for your patience 🐺 :cyberheart:

@kohshiba Can you give some info on what's expected to be included in a the merkle trees submitted to markets when an incident occurs?


[01/07/2022 1:28 AM] Tom | Aztec#3331
i.e. why is inclusion in the merkle tree necessary since it seems that all required data is available onchain. Also under what circumstances would we go down the `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_insurance.target, address(0)))` path here? https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L568-L582


[01/07/2022 3:38 AM] kohshiba
merkle tree is used to verify whether an insurance policy holder is eligible to redeem. 
a raw data before merkle looks like:
```
 [
        { id: "0x...", account: "0x..." },
        { id: "0x...", account: "0x..." },
        { id: "0x...", account: "0x..." },
        { id: "0x...", account: "0x..." },
        { id: "0x...", account: "0x..." },
];
```
We only allow when the account has an eligible insurance policy (hashed data of insurance ID and  account address)

>under what circumstances would we go down the keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_insurance.target, address(0))) path here?
Sometimes, a pool allows all insurance policy holders to redeem. The path of address zero is used in such case

Thank you code4rena managers and wardens 😆 
InsureDAO devs are here (our timezone is **JST**), so feel free to ping and ask anything!


[01/07/2022 11:39 AM] Tom | Aztec#3331
I'm clear on the structure of the data as that can be seen from the code. I'm more interested in the decision making on why this tree exists and what goes into it - considering claims are being made against a relatively small number of targets and the target associated with a policy is onchain then policy validity should be verifiable onchain without the need for a merkle tree.


[01/08/2022 4:05 AM] Oishun#3920
When incident happens on a protocol, ReportingDAO (incident oracle) investigate and lists all the victim addresses in general.
Then, execute applyCover() with its merkle root.
So, merkle tree contains not only the claimable addresses on InsureDAO, but also the non insurance holder.


[01/08/2022 9:33 AM] Oishun#3920
does this make sense?


[01/08/2022 5:12 PM] danb#6193
what are attributions and credits?


[01/09/2022 2:36 AM] dravee
Hello! Sorry if the question is stupid... But are contracts that are named "*Template.sol" functionally meant to be inherited at some point? They do implement some interfaces but I'm not sure if they'll have children someday 😅


[01/09/2022 5:07 AM] kohshiba
Adding some info. The thing is that not all policyholders can redeem their policy. ReportingDAO only allow actual victims to redeem, meaning hackers, or other speculators can get eliminated from the list.


[01/09/2022 5:09 AM] kohshiba
>Attributions
we use `attribution` as internal token of `Vault.sol` Since Vault utilize stored funds and earn from it, the value per attribution may increase. so there will be two bookkeeping systems within the mechanism, one is underwriters LP token(iToken) and the other one is pool's attribution.
>Credit
An index pool can leverage the liquidity(allowing fractional collateral) and deploy the liquidity to underlying pools. `credit` is the unit name of indices' liquidity within pools.


[01/09/2022 5:19 AM] kohshiba
NP! yes, `*Template.sol` means they are templates, meaning it can be referred from a proxy contract. InsureDAO's `Factory.sol` can create pools, but each pool is just a proxy contract based on EIP 1167 (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1167.md) to save gas cost on each creation.

We are about to end of the audit!
Thank you for joining InsureDAO contest! :Logo: 

We are going to have next time in here with new implementation, so wardens that have read our code must have advantage from next time :C4Keycap:
